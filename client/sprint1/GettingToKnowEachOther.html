<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi everybody!  My name is Kyle Brick and above I gave you guys my email, and the picture is of me and my older sister Katie.  I'm the youngest of three siblings
and both of my older siblings are Lewis alumni.  I'm a senior in the Computer Science program at Lewis.  I've worked in Database Management where I mainly coded small
scripts to help move data around more efficiently to get it to product teams quicker and in a better format.  However, cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and 
video-game development are fields that interest me a lot more.</p>

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>

<p><ul style="list-style-type: square">
	<li>Experience with Scrum/Agile team development</li>
	<li>Processes of software development</li>
	<li>Architecture when beginning a new, complex project</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>

<p>My favorite hobby would either be playing videogames, tennis, or bowling.  I've done all three my entire life, and enjoy them a lot.  When I'm tired or lazy I'll stay 
home and play games with friends, and if I want to get some exercise or it's nice outside I'll either run to the courts at Joliet West/JCA or a bowling alley near me.  I 
also think these are good hobbies because you can do them all on your own, and with a group of friends too.</p>
